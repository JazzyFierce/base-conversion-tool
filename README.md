Version History:

3-27-2022: Implemented basic functionality, assuming valid inputs.

3-29-2022: Base Conversion Tool - now with completely class-based implementation!

-dec_to_any_v1 changed to only be precise to 15 digits. This is not ideal, but keeps the program from entering an infinite calculation loop. Rounding is considered

-Added functionality for converting to bases above 36

3-30-2022: I wanted to use match cases, but the world simply isn't ready for that... all match cases changed to if/else blocks
